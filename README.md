# RoboRocky
RoboRocky uses pydrake to build a simulation of a fully activated RR robot with a punching glove as the end effector. Our setup includes the ally and the enemy 


### Ideas: 
Vary the x distance so that the target is closer / further away from the punching glove, but make sure the distance is < total arm length so it is reachable 

Maybe have shoulder joint cost 1.5x the energy than the elbow

Try optimizing for speed / power and see the difference
